1.To set up a web server and PHP on your laptop, begin by downloading and installing a web server software package like Apache or Nginx. You can find Apache at https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi and Nginx at https://nginx.org/en/download.html. Follow the instructions provided on the respective websites to complete the installation.

2.Once the web server is installed, proceed to download and install the latest version of PHP from https://www.php.net/downloads.php, following the instructions provided on the website.

3.Next, configure your web server to work with PHP. The steps to do this will depend on the specific web server you have installed. For example, to enable PHP on Apache, you can use a configuration file like httpd.conf or apache2.conf, while on Nginx, you can use the fastcgi_pass directive.

4.To test your PHP installation, create a PHP file and place it in the web server's document root directory. Th.is directory is where the web server serves files from; for Apache, the document root is usually /var/www/html, and for Nginx, it's typically /usr/share/nginx/html.

5.Finally, open your web browser and navigate to the URL of the PHP file you just created. If everything is configured correctly, you should see the output of the PHP script displayed in your browser.
